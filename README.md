## Background

Cardinal is a composable protocol for issuing conditional NFTs that are managed by the protocol. Using the invalidators and approvers in various ways allows for building rentals, in-game items, DNS services and more.

Carinal protocol provides a service for rentals that allow anybody to spin up their own rental manager with distinct parameters that allow their users to rent from the rental manager or create one-off rentals.

## Addresses

Program addresses are the same on devnet, testnet, and mainnet-beta.

## Documentation

Documentation is a work in progress. For now, one should read [the end-to-end tests of the SDK](/tests/mintWrapper.spec.ts).

We soon plan on releasing a React library to make it easy to integrate Cardinal with your frontend.
